I will never force anyone to choose me. If you believe you can find something better elsewhere, then go ahead—I am not holding you back. Life is too short to hang on to someone who's not sure they want to stay. I believe in the freedom and truth of feelings.

If you must stay, let it be because your heart tells you this is where you belong, not because I asked you to. I want to be a choice, not a default option. I deserve someone who sees my value and understands what I bring to their life. I don’t want someone who stays out of fear of loneliness or habit. I want someone who stays because they can’t imagine life without me.

The door is always open, and you are free to leave at any time. If you believe your happiness lies elsewhere, I won’t stand in your way. In the meantime, I will keep moving forward. I will continue to build my own life and find happiness on my own because my happiness doesn’t depend on your presence but on my own ability to find it.
